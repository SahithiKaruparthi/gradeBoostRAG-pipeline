- Size: Cells are small (microscopic) in size with large
surface-volume ratio to facilitate greater diffusion of
substances inward and outward.
- Shape: Cells have scores of different shapes to suit
their functions, e.g. guard cells of stomata are bean-
shaped for closing and opening, WBCs are amoeboid
to squeeze out of capillary walls, etc.
- Cell membrane (also called plasma membrane) bounds
the surface of all living cells. It is semi-permeable,
preventing others.
- Cell wall is an extra covering outside the cell membran
in plant cells. It provides shape and rigidity. It is freel
permeable and is made up of cellulose.
- Nucleus is the specialised central part of a cell that
controls the activities of cells, and contains the
chromosomes having genes. A cell with its nucleus
removed dies soon.
- Cytoplasm is the living part of a cell inside the cell
membrane but excludes the nucleus. Cytoplasm and
nucleus together constitute the protoplasm.
