- As a result of his breeding experiments on garden pea, Mendel discovered three basic laws of heredity  Law of dominance
Law of segregation and Law of independent assortment. - Mendel crossed two pure breeding varieties of pea plant by taking contrasting traits of one single character (monohybrid
cross) and contrasting traits of two different characters (dihybrid cross). - When two homozygous pea plants with contrasting traits are crossed, a heterozygous hybrid plant is obtained. This is the
F1 generation. - When two hybrid plants of $F_{1}$ generation are self-crossed, we obtain the $F_{2}$ generation
- For a monohybrid cross, Mendel found the phenotypic and genotypic ratios of F2 generation to be 3:1 and 1:2:1
respectively. - For a dihybrid cross, the $F_{2}$ phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1, while the genotypic ratio is complex
- Mutations are sudden changes in the genes in the progeny. Some mutations can alter certain characters or traits in an
entire population and such changes can persist for years.
