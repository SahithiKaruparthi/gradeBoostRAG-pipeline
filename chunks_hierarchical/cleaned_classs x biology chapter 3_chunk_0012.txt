-------------------- CONTENT --------------------

The three situations pertaining to any pair of genes, as for example in tongue rolling, can be as follows:
(i) RR (both dominant) - TONGUE ROLLER
(ii) Rr (one dominant, one recessive)  TONGUE ROLLER
(iii) rr (both recessive) - NON-ROLLER
You can see from the above example that the tongue rollers have two kinds of genetic constitutions (RR or Rr) whereas non-rollers have only one genetic constitution (rr).
The genetic constitutions (pertaining to the kinds of genes possessed) are called genotype and the expressed shown character is called phenotype ( phene: to show). Thus, for the phenotype (for tongue rollers), there are two genotypes:
i) homozygous dominant, that has similar pair RR (homo: similar, zygos: pair)
(ii) heterozygous dominant with dissimilar pair $\mathrm{Rr}$ (hetero: different, zygos: pair)
The genotype of non-roller is just one single homozygous recessive pair rr.!Figure(figures/classs x biology chapter 3_page_005_figure_025_error.png)
