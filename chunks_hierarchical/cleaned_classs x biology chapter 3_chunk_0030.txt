- Chromosomes are the carrlers of heredity
- Y-chromosome is larger than $Y$-chromosome and carries more genes. - The birth of a son or a daughter is just a matter of chance depending on the kind of spontaneous
Y-bearing) that fertilises the egg (X-bearing). - The XX combination makes a female and the XY makes a male. - Genes are specific DNA segments that control the expression of a character. Every gene has two alternatives: $\ldots, \ldots$
objects can be super-ruling allele is called dominant and the submissive one is called recessive. - alleles  the slope falling into a point of view, and is not possible to be determined by the same
criteria for each other. The group contains two types: one-sided or three-sided items that are used as a proxy
- Genotype is the combination of genes, and phenotype is the expressed character. - Certain disorders are caused by genes located exclusively on X-chromosome (and not on Y), like colour-blindness and
haemophilia. Mostly, the males only suffer from these as they have single X chromosome and very rarely, the females.
