(Mother to Son and Father to daughter)
Inheritance of X-linked genes as in colour blindness and haemophilia is also called criss-cross inheritance. This is because the son may get it from the otherwise normal but carrier mother (as in case 2) and a colour blind father may pass it on to the daughter making her colour-blind if the mother is a carrier. (Refer to case 3, if you have solved it.)
