OFFSPRING (FEMALE)
(a) Can you tell which coat colour (black or white) is dominant?............................................................... (b) Is the coat colour sex-linked? 3. Make a Punnett square and find out the genotypic and phenotypic ratios of F 2 generation in the progeny of a genetic cross between:
(a) A pure tall (TT) pea plant with a pure dwarf (tt pea plant. (b) Red flower variety of pea (RR) with white flowet variety of pea (rr). 4. Mendel crossed a homozygous pea plant having round seeds (RR) with a homozygous pea plant having wrinkled seeds (rr). He got different results. On the basis of it, answer the following questions:
(a) Which character of seed is studied in the experiment
(b) Which of the above two traits is dominant? (c) Write the phenotype and genotype of $F_1$ offsprings. (d) Mention and state the Mendel's law shown in th
(e) Make a Punnett square for $F_{2}$ generation when two plants of $F_{1}$ offspring are crossed with each other. (f) Write the phenotypic ratio of $F_{2}$ progeny. (g) What will be the genotypic ratio of $F_{2}$ off:
(h) What are the two traits of seed colour? Also mention which is dominant and recessive?
