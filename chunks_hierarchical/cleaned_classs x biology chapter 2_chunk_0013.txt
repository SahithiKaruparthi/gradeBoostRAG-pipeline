-------------------- CONTENT --------------------

The interphase itself has three phases  (i) first growth phase, (ii) synthesis phase and (iii) second growth phase. (i) First Growth Phase $\left(G_{1}\right)$  RNA and proteins are synthesised and the volume of cytoplasm increases. Mitochondria (in animal cells) and chloroplasts (in plant cells) divide  these two organelles have their own DNA. In late G 1 phase, all cells must follow one of the two paths. They may either withdraw from the cell cycle and enter a resting phase (R) or start preparing for the next division by entering the next synthesis phase (S). - (ii) Synthesis Phase (S)  More DNA is
synthesised and the chromosomes are duplicated. - (iii) Second Growth Phase (G 2 )  This is a
shorter growth phase, in which RNA and proteins
necessary for cell division continue to be synthesised. enter the dividing phase of the cell cycle. After the
dividing phase gets completed, the newly formed
way the cell cycle goes on and on.!Figure(figures/classs x biology chapter 2_page_005_figure_017_error.png)
