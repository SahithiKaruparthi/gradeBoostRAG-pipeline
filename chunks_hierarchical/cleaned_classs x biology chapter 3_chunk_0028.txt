-------------------- CONTENT --------------------

Mutation is a sudden change in one or more genes, or in the number or in the structure of chromosomes.
Mutation alters the hereditary material of an organisms cells and results in a change in certain characters or traits.
For example:
- (i) Sickle cell anaemia is a blood disease caused
by a gene mutation. The mutation causes
of sickle-shaped RBCs.
- ii) Radioactive radiations also alter the gene
generation after generation. An atomic
World War-II 1945 in Japan (Hiroshima,
Nagasaki), had led to a number of deformities
still persisting.
