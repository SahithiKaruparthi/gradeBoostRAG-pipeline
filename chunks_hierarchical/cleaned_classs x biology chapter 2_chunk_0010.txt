-------------------- CONTENT --------------------

New cells need to be produced for (1) growth (2) replacement, (3) repair and (4) reproduction.. For growth: Most organisms, including plants and animals, begin their life as a single cell (the fertilized egg, i.e. zygote). This cell divides repeatedly to form a cluster of cells which start shaping for different functions to form tissues and organs. Thus, cell division is essential for growth. A 4-day-old human embryo containing 16 ells, resulting from four cell divisions 1  2 = 2; 2  2 = 4; 4  2 = 8; 8  2 = 16. As they multiply, they specialise to form the tissues and organs of the body. 2. For replacement: There is always a wear and tear of cells during the normal body functions. For example, 2 million red blood cells in our body are destroyed every second. These are replaced by new cells formed through a division of their parent cells in the bone marrow. In plants, the old and dried leaves fall off and new ones grow out. 3. For repair: Apart from normal wear and tear of the tissues in the body, there may be accidental injuries. One may get cuts in the skin or fractures in the bone.
