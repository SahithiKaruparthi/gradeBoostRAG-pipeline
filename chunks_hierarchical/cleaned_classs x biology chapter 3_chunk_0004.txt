-------------------- CONTENT --------------------

Human beings as a species share many main characters or traits among themselves which identify the species Homo sapiens. Yet, the various races or tribes look different in several features. Even within the same race or tribe, the individual members in the population show differences. Further, within a family, members show differences in body features. These small differences among the individuals of the same species are called variations.
The same is true for animals also. We keep pets, like dog or cat and domesticate animals, like cow or buffalo. There are so many breeds of each one of them and even in the same breed, there are minor differences and variations among individuals.
