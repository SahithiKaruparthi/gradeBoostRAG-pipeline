-------------------- CONTENT --------------------

There are two types of cell divisions:
1. Mitosis: Cell division leading to the production of diploid cells for growth and development. 2. Meiosis: Cell division leading to the production of haploid cells or gametes (sperms or egg). 2.8.1 MITOSIS (mitos: thread, referring to chromatin thread)
MITOSIS is the cell division in which one parent cell divides into two identical daughter cells. The most important aspect of mitosis is that the
same normal chromosome number is maintained at each cell division. Phases of mitosis: Mitosis is completed in two steps: Karyokinesis and Cytokinesis. Karyokinesis (Division of nucleus
Karyokinesis of mitosis occurs in four main phases although each of these phases merges into the next phase thereby making it a continuous process. The four phases of mitosis are:
(i) Prophase (ii) Metaphase
(iii) Anaphase (iv) Telophase
By and large, the four phases of mitosis are similar in both animal and plant cells. However, we are
