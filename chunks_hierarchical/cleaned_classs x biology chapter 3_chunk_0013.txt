A pedigree (family) chart showing inheritance of the ability to roll the tongue. (Symbols: O = female
Observe the following points in the above pedigree (family) chart:
- Males are shown by squares and females by circles.
- Both father and mother are tongue rollers (hollow
symbols represent the usual expressed character).
- Of the three children born, two can roll (hollow
symbols) and one cannot (solid symbol).
- The recessive trait (rr) of non-rolling in one of
but the parents.
- The non-roller child in the family chart with
other parent.
- Conclusion is that each of the two parents is
heterozygous (Rr).
- If, on the other hand, one parent was
homozygous (similar pair RR) dominant and the
other heterozygous (dissimilar pair Rr) dominant,
- parent through the sex cells. The situation car
square (A possible family where both parents are phenotypically similar (tongue rollers) but genotypically dissimilar (one homozygous dominant  RR" and the other heterozygous  Rr). All their children will be tongue rollers.
