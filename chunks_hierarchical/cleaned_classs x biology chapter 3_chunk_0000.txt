Whenever a child is born the family members usually start comparing the child's appearance as to whom he/she resembles more. All this, although a matter of chance, is governed by certain laws. This chapter presents some fundamentals of Genetics including Mendel's laws of inheritance as envisaged in the syllabus. In order to properly understand Mendel's laws of inheritance and the sex-linked inheritance, it is essential to know beforehand, some basic aspects of genetics. You will learn about the chromosomes, the genes and some very common hereditary traits in humans. You can do several investigatory projects, if desired.
