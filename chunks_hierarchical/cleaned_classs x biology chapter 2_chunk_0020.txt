-------------------- CONTENT --------------------

- Both mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own
DNA (containing certain genes).
- They also contain their own ribosomes which help
organelles.
- Both of these divide of their own by simple
fission, just splitting into two and are partitioned
mitosis.
- Mitochondrial division is also guided by the
ribosomes.
