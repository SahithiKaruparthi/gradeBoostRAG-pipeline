-------------------- CONTENT --------------------

Thus, a recessive gene is one which, in the presence of the contrasting (dominant) gene, is not expressed. ALLELES: Alternative forms of a gene, occupying the same position (locus) on homologous chromosomes and affecting the same characteristic but in different ways. A pair of chromosomes showing four imaginary genes A, B, C, and D. The situations depicted here are:
(i) AA is homozygous (similar) dominant pair,
(ii) bb is homozygous (similar) recessive pair and
(iii) Cc and dD are heterozygous (dissimilar) pairs
Dominant Allele: The kind of allele which expresses itself regardless of the presence of another allele/s for a given gene. e.g. The dominant allele for height in garden pea is tall. Recessive Allele: The kind of allele whose expression is suppressed in presence of a dominant allele for a given gene. A recessive allele can only express itself in presence of the same recessive allele. e.g. The recessive allele for height in garden pea is dwarf. Remember - The chromosome as a whole can neither be dominant nor recessive.
