Dihybrid ratio gives us the breeding results with two pairs of contrasting characters. Mendel tried several combinations. One such combination was the crossing of a variety with round and yellow seeds with another variety having wrinkled and green seeds.!Figure(figures/classs x biology chapter 3_page_011_figure_005_error.png)
The ratio is 9:3:3:1
The above results from parents to $F_{1}$ and then to $F_{2}$ can be easily understood from the following:!Figure(figures/classs x biology chapter 3_page_011_figure_008_error.png)
Thus, the two kinds of ratios in the two kinds of hybridisations are as follows:
Monohybrid ratios in $F_{2}$ generation
Phenotypic ratio 3:
Genotypic ratio  1:2:1
Dihybrid ratios in $F_{2}$ generation
Phenotypic ratio  9: 3: 3: 1
Genotypic ratio  (very complex)
