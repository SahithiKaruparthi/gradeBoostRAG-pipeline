This consisted of the following:
Phenotypic (visible feature) ratio = 3:1 (three axillary and one terminal) Genotypic (gene feature) ratio = 1:2:1 (one AA, two Aa and one aa) CASE 2: Pure tall (TT) pea plants were crossed with dwarf (tt) plants and the progenies in the F1 and F2 generation were obtained as follows:!Figure(figures/classs x biology chapter 3_page_010_figure_007_error.png)
CASE 3: Similarly, on crossing the plants grown from pure round (RR) seeds with plants grown from pure wrinkled (rr) seeds, the results were as given below:!Figure(figures/classs x biology chapter 3_page_010_figure_009_error.png)
In all the above three cases, the monohybrid ratios are same:
Phenotypic ratio 3:1
Genotypic ratio 1:2:1
Some of the generalized principles based on the above breeding experiments were as follows:
1. Each pair of contrasting characters depends a pair of genes. 2. Each individual carries such genes in dup-
3. An individual produces gametes (sex cells) which have only one member of a pair of genes. 4. Fertilization of the gametes restores the duplicate condition of the genes. 5. Sex cells with respect to the genes they contain, get fertilised at random.
