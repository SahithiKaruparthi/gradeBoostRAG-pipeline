Chromosomes in animals were first studied in 1882 by a German Scientist, Walther Flemming. He noticed these in the rapidly dividing cells of the larvae of salamander (an amphibian). The microscope he used was of old type and through it, he saw minute threads that appeared to be dividing lengthwise. Flemming called their division mitosis (literally meaning  thread"). Subsequently, with the help of

more powerful microscopes and by using special techniques, the chromosomes and their constituents have been studied in great detail.
