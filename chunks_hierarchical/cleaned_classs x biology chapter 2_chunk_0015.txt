- Epithelial cells lining the gut last only 5 days
-  Average life of other gut cells is about 15 years
-  Liver cells are replaced every 1 to 2 years
- In plants, the cells at the growing points
(meristems) divide very rapidly and produce new
leaves, buds and flowers, etc. -  Specialised germinal cells in the ovary and testis
meiosis to produce sex cells. - Uncontrolled non-stop cell cycles may lead to
tumours that may or may not be cancerous. - As children we grow, because new cells are
outnumber the dying cells. - When we are adults, our cell population stays
constant. The number of new cells produced
equals the number of cells dying. - As we grow old, the number of new cells
produced runs short of those that are dying.
