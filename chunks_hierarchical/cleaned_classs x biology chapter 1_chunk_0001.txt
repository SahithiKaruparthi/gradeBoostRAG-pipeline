All living things are made up of microscopic cells. Some living things are formed of just one cell, like
the bacteria and Amoeba, while large plants and animals are composed of billions of cells. Unicellular organisms: Living organisms made up of only a single cell are called unicellular organisms. Examples: Amoeba, Paramecium, bacteria, Chlamydomonas. Multicellular organisms: Majority of living organisms are made up of millions or billions of cells and are called multicellular organisms. Examples: Volvox, rose, mosquito, mango, humans. An average-sized adult human is composed of approximately:
- 200 different types of cells
- 37-2 trillion cells in the whole body. - 100 billion nerve cells in the brain cortex. -  25 trillion red blood cells. 1.3 CELLS  HOW SMALL? Cells are very small and can be seen only with the help of a microscope. -  Smallest cells are certain bacteria, red blood
cells in the human body, etc. -  Longest cells are the nerve cells
-  Largest cells are the birds' eggs (actually the central
yellow sphere). Ostrich egg, before development
begins in it, is the largest single cell of the living
world today.
