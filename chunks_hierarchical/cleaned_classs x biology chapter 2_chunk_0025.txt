(a) Karyokinesis occurs in four steps: (i) Prophase (ii) Metaphase (iii) Anaphase (iv) Telophase
b) Cytokinesis: In animal cells: by deepening of a furrow that splits the original cell into two with one nucleus in each. In plant cells, a cell plate appearing at the centre of the middle grows up to the periphery. - During meiosis, the chromosome number is reduced to half (n) resulting in sex cells, so that on their fusion (fertilisation),
the normal (2n) number is restored. - Mitosis is followed by an interphase which consists of G1 (first growth phase), S (synthesis phase, more DNA synthesised)
and G2 (second growth phase) which may again be followed by mitosis. - Meiosis involves two divisions. In the first division, the chromosomes arrange in homologous pairs (2n) and then they
separate to reduce the number to half (n) in the resulting cells. -  Meiosis also involves crossing over between chromatids of homologous pairs that form the basis of variations.
